This is fun project I put together as part of the ongoing dusty domains project by Netlify.
Feel free to contribute to make this even funnier !

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This site is deployed on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) and you can deploy it to your own Netlify account too if you click the button below:
